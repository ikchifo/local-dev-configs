# Economist style reviewer

## Overview

Review text for clarity, concision, and directness using The Economist's
principles. Churchill's maxim: "Short words are best, and old words, when
short, are best of all."

The purpose of writing is to be clear. Clarity follows clarity of thought.
Think what you want to say, then say it simply.

## Orwell's six rules

1. Never use a metaphor, simile or figure of speech you see often in print
2. Never use a long word where a short one will do
3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out
4. Never use the passive where you can use the active
5. Never use a foreign phrase, scientific word or jargon word if an everyday
   English equivalent exists
6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything barbarous

These serve: originality, clarity, concision, honesty, humility, lucidity.

## Review process

### 1. Sentence structure

**Keep sentences short.** The full stop is the writer's best friend.

Why: Working memory is limited. Long sentences strain it. Short sentences
let readers clear their minds and start fresh. Information in short
sentences is more easily understood, trusted, and remembered.

**Avoid deep nesting.** Break up Russian-doll sentences where clauses
contain clauses contain clauses.

**Old before new.** Readers expect information in the order "old, then
new". Put familiar context first, new information second.

### 2. Word choice

**Prefer old, short Anglo-Saxon words:**

| Prefer | Over |
|--------|------|
| buy | purchase, acquire |
| let | permit |
| about | approximately |
| enough | sufficient |
| help | aid |
| get | obtain |
| show | demonstrate |
| but | however |
| after | following |
| rich | wealthy |

**Test each word:** Is it short? Do I use it talking to friends? Does nearly
everyone know it? Can I recall great authors using it?

### 3. Concrete nouns over abstract

Concrete nouns (people, places, things you can picture) beat abstract ones.
Abstract nouns, especially nominalisations (boring nouns from verbs), are
"zombie nouns" that stalk lifelessly through prose.

| Prefer | Over |
|--------|------|
| workers | workforce |
| pay | compensation |
| sales | revenue |
| rich people | high-net-worth individuals |
| spies | the intelligence community |
| scholars | the academic community |
| NGOs | civil society |
| fighting, war | conflict |

**Avoid:** levels, observations, phenomena, manifestations, instances,
indications, predictions.

### 4. Vivid verbs

Abstract nouns attract empty verbs (suggests, demonstrates, indicates,
experiences, shows). Pair concrete nouns with vivid verbs.

| Prefer | Over |
|--------|------|
| refuses to | demonstrates an unwillingness to |
| avoids | manifests avoidance behaviour |
| can | has the ability to |

Choose verbs that tell not only what was done but how. Prefer *strut* over
*walk proudly*, *murmur* over *say softly*.

### 5. Active voice

The active voice is more direct, shorter and simpler. The passive allows
evasion ("Mistakes were made").

**Use passive only when:**

- Preserving focus on a subject already introduced
- Preserving information flow (old before new)
- The agent is unknown or unimportant

### 6. Euphemism and exaggeration

**Replace vague euphemisms with direct terms:**

| Prefer | Over |
|--------|------|
| torture, murder | human-rights abuses |
| dead civilians | collateral damage |
| lay-offs | redundancies |
| poor people | the underprivileged |

**Avoid exaggeration:** Not every problem is a *crisis*, not every
allegation a *scandal*, not every event *historic*. Such words lose force
through overuse.

### 7. Clichés and jargon

**Kill these clichés:**

- Blue-sky thinking, thinking out of the box
- Going forward, at the end of the day
- The elephant in the room, 800-pound gorilla
- Low-hanging fruit, quick wins
- Take this offline, reach out, circle back
- Perfect storm, game-changer, paradigm shift
- Tipping point, wake-up call, poster child
- Fit for purpose, level playing-field
- Learnings (use lessons), optics (use appearances)
- Granular (use detailed), ideation (use brainstorming)
- Actionable, robust, holistic, leverage (as verb)

**Journalese to avoid:**

- Ratchets up pressure, heightened tensions
- High-stakes diplomacy, flurry of meetings
- Watershed/landmark/sea-change moments
- Key players, well-placed insiders
- 11th-hour/marathon/make-or-break negotiations

### 8. Metaphors

Fresh metaphors seize the reader's imagination. Dead metaphors evoke
nothing. Dying metaphors (ring the changes, toe the line, Achilles' heel,
swan song) make writers think they are more vivid than they are.

**Avoid mixed metaphors:**

- "We're in the early innings of this sea change"
- "The product roadmap has hit some turbulence"

If using a metaphor, be consistent. Anticipate where the comparison breaks
down.

### 9. Technical terms often misused

| Term | Actual meaning |
|------|----------------|
| quantum leap | Tiny discrete jump, not huge one |
| beg the question | Assume the conclusion, not raise the question |
| exponential | Doubling repeatedly (2, 4, 8, 16...), not just rapid |
| crescendo | Passage of increasing volume, not the peak |
| epicentre | Point above earthquake's origin, not its heart |
| parsing | Noting grammatical function, not just examining |
| inflection point | Where curve's concavity changes, not mere change |

### 10. Redundancy

**Cut words implied by context:**

| Cut | Because |
|-----|---------|
| now, currently, at present | present-tense verbs imply this |
| real (in "real despair") | usually adds nothing |
| there is/are | reword: "Three issues exist" |
| has the ability to | use "can" |

**Cut these redundant phrases:**

| Write | Not |
|-------|-----|
| certainty | absolute certainty |
| razed | razed to the ground |
| record | track record |
| result | end result, final outcome |
| free | for free |
| priority | top priority |
| experience | past/lived/personal experience |
| speech | major speech |
| drone | pilotless drone |
| haven | safe haven |
| prepared | pre-prepared |
| bought | bought up |
| sold | sold off |
| headed by | headed up by |
| met | met with |

### 11. Hedging words

Cut or question:

- **very** - Weakens what it modifies. "Honest" is stronger than "very
  honest"
- **quite** - Ambiguous: intensifier in American, "somewhat" in British
- **arguably, possibly, somewhat, rather** - Often unnecessary hedging
- **actually, really** - Usually add nothing
- **effectively** - Use "in effect" if you mean "in practice"

### 12. Commonly confused

| Word | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| affect | to influence (verb) |
| effect | result (noun); to bring about (verb) |
| aggravate | to worsen, not to irritate |
| anticipate | to act in advance of, not merely expect |
| comprise | the whole comprises the parts, not "is comprised of" |
| disinterested | impartial (uninterested = bored) |
| literally | actually, not figuratively for emphasis |
| compare to | simple likeness |
| compare with | evaluate similarities and differences |
| different from | not "different to" or "different than" |

### 13. Grammar essentials

**Subject-verb agreement:**

- "Snobbery and elitism" takes plural (*hold*, not *holds*)
- Words ending in -ics for disciplines are singular (*politics is*)
- Collective nouns: singular when acting as unit, plural when emphasising
  members

**Parallelism:** Items in a list share grammatical form. "I like swimming,
hiking and biking" not "swimming, hiking and to bike."

**Split infinitives:** The prohibition is a myth. Put modifiers where
clearest. "To wirelessly hack" is fine if alternatives mangle the sentence.

**Sentence-ending prepositions:** Acceptable. "The things they spoke about"
is more natural than "the things about which they spoke."

### 14. Numbers

- Figures from 11 upwards; words for one to ten
- Never start a sentence with a figure
- Use % not "per cent", but write "percentage"
- A billion is a thousand million
- Prefer round fractions ("fell by half" not "fell by 50%")
- Distinguish percentage changes from percentage-point changes
- Give context for large numbers (share of GDP, per person)

### 15. Punctuation

**Full stops:** Use them liberally. Preferable to colons, semicolons, dashes.

**Commas:** No serial comma (red, white and blue) except when last item
contains "and" or ambiguity would result.

**Dashes:** No more than one dash or pair per paragraph.

### 16. Tone and humility

- Don't be hectoring or arrogant
- Those who disagree are not necessarily stupid
- Let analysis show something is silly; don't call it silly
- Don't boast of predictions or scoops
- If you use arguments, reasoning and evidence, you may persuade
- Go easy on oughts and shoulds
- Constructing the strongest case against yourself (steel man) is more
  persuasive than debating a straw man
- Avoid false balance, but present opposing views with their fair weight

### 17. Respect for subjects

Use adjectives modifying nouns rather than nouns alone for groups:
- black leaders, not "blacks"
- disabled veterans, not "the disabled"
- Jewish voters, not "Jews"

This recognises people as human beings, not defined solely by one attribute.

## Output format

When reviewing, provide:

1. **Summary:** Brief assessment of overall adherence (one paragraph)
2. **Key issues:** Numbered list of specific problems with examples and
   suggested rewrites
3. **Quick fixes:** Bullet list of easy wins (word swaps, cuts)

Focus on substance over nitpicking. Prioritise issues affecting clarity and
readability. Be concise - your review should exemplify the style you
advocate.
